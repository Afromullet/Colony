yield strength
lowest stress that produces a permanent deformation in a material

compressive strength (fracture)
a limit state of compressive stress that leads to failure in a material in the manner of ductile failure

tensile strength
pulling
impact strength


momentum = mass * velocity

Forces

Impact
Sudden strike, I.E, hammer

Compressive
Pressure

Tensile
Pulling on something

Torsion
Force applied by twisting something

Shear
Force applied by pushing part of a material so it tries to slide relative to another part (cutting)

Bending




impact yield - impact before deforming
impact fracture - impact before faiing

compressive yield
compressive fracture

tensile yield
tensile frature

shear yield
shear fracture

bending yield
bending fracture

density
