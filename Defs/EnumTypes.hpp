/*Some enumerated types used throughout the program. Not too sure if I should handle the parts that use enums the way I do. I rather use enums than class types, since not everything will be polymorphic or object oriented. For example, there's no need to have a different class for spears and swords. They just have to be broken down into some general properties and identified by their enum
