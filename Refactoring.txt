List of refactored Parts

1) Improve Constructors. For every class -
    Create copy constructors
    Assignment operators

    Constructor for various cases of instaniating the class

    Handle invalid input

2) Function improvement

    Invalid input checking - wherever necessary
    Determine whether it can be broken apart

3)    Overload operators when necessary
        Equality
        !=
        <
        >


4) Memory management

5) Reduce STL usage
    Use arrays when vectors are not necessary

6) Change to private datatypes where applicable, along with other access modifiers

7)  Get rid of enums when applicable

8) For when you still need to use STL, use iterators rather than size() i++

9) Write down things you may want to handle differently

10) Destructors

11) Need to manage all items and creature in the world a better way

12) Handle equipping items differently

13) Determine what functions you no longer need

14) Use constants where applicable
