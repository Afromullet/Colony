/*
 If shear strength of attacking material < strength of defending material, do nothing
 
If shear fracture strength of material > shear fracture sstrength of defending material
    Dent/Bent material, maybe cause bruising
 Else
    Cut through material. Damage tissue, cut through tissue
 
 
 if impact strngth < impact strength of defending material
    Deflect
 
 If impact strength > defending material impact strength
    Dent/Bent, cause bruises
 
 if impact fracture strenght > defending equivalent
    Dent/bent armor more, heavier bruising
    If much greater, break bones, internal damage

/*
 
 The idea is to take the different kind of forces and for that kind of force, determine how the material is effected
 
 defSrength is resistance to deformation.
 fractStrength is resistance to fracture
 
 comp - compressive force

 Impact - sudden strikes
 
 Compressive - Pressure (Pushes) (deforms the material, i.e, turning steel into a sheet or armor into a ball)
 
 Tensile - Pulling (elongates, breaks the material into two)
 
 Torsion - Twisting
 
 Shear - Cutting
 

ductility - ability to undergo significant plastic deformation without rupture - under tensile stress
 
 malleability - ability to deform under compressive stress. more malleable, easier to change shape with compressive force
 
 

 Effects on material s according to force applied:
 
 Tension - Elongates the material, eventually tears it apart
 Compression - Squeezes the material together, decreasing its size
 Shear - A crack of Tear forms in the material
 Torsion - ???
 Impact - Applies force beneath the armor, can break through it also
 
 
 Somehow calculate plasticity for each characteristics with the force and density
 
 
stress applied = force / area
 
 
 Material can absorb force..Even if the material is cut through, there was still some force absorbed
 
 */

/*The type of force applied determines how the material deforms
Or fractures. Shear will cut through the armor, impact will shatter it, etc
 
 DefEffects are deformation Effects and FracEffects are fracture effects
 
 This lets us identify what sort of effect is being applied

 Steps to apply effects
 
 1) SetupForce - this is the force that is being applied to this material
 2) CalculateForcePenentration() - This does the calculations that determines how much force is left after the material absoroption
 3) Whatever called the material functions will call getAppliedForceEffects 
 4) DetermineWoundSeverity
