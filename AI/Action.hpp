/*
 There is an action queue, which is why there is an action parent class.
 Every subclass will not be required to implement all of the virtual function, so they are not pure virtual functions.
 
 This makes it easier to handle things at a higher level without having to worry about separate types of actions, I.E, attack actions, move actions, etc etc
