#ifndef MovementHandler_hpp

//Handles creature movement..maybe in the future, I should define interaction between a creture and a map in another class or file where the functions describe the interactions between the classes

//Whenever a creature moves, it has to go through this handler to determine
//whether the move is successful. Currently, not yet an object..This is a prototype. Once the basics have been worked out, I'll organize it differently
